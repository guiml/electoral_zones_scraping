# Electoral Zone Scraping

During my vacation, I decided to discover if there was any relationship between the average earnings and the candidate chosen for president in the past elections in my city (Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil). To complete that work I needed the specific addresses of the electoral zones, but this information was shown only in HTML. So I built a scraping script to convert the HTML information into tabular information. This project covers the scraping code I used to achieve that result.
